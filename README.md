## Description:
Patches programmed in Open Music exploring several composition techniques, or musical analysis by synthesis.<br>
NOTE: this is a working in progress, continuous update.

## Operation Mode
Drag the folders to the Open music Workspace. Although these patches work as subpatches, I've added a complete patch with no dependencies - all patches are abstractions in order to guarantee you should always understand the connections.<br>
Enjoy.

## Patch List
- asd_OM_glosaFigurs - it generates a set of melodic figures resulting from the analysis of two motifs, recapturing the idea of glosa.
- asd_OM_palimpsest_filter - it takes two input MIDI files (a source file and a modulator file) and produces a third MIDI file according to one of two main operation modes.
- asd_OM_fractalize - generation of recursive patterns
- asd_OM_harmonictransposition - harmonic transpositions from a chord/motif

## References
