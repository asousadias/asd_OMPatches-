# Open Music Patches Collection
Compositional techniques programmed as Open Music patches.

programming by Antonio de Sousa Dias

(continuous update)

Patches programmed in Open Music exploring several compotion techniques, or musical analysis by synthesis.

## Operation Mode
Drag the folders to the Open music Workspace. Although these patches work as subpatches, I've added a complete patch with no dependencies - all patches are abstractions in order to garatee you should allways understand the connections. Enjoy.

## Patch List
- asd_OM_glosaFigurs - it generates a set of melodic figures resulting from the analysis of two motifs, recapturing the idea of glosa.
- asd_OM_palimpsest_filter - it takes two input MIDI files (a source file and a modulator file) and produces a third MIDI file according to one of two main operation modes.
