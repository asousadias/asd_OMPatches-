## Description:
FRACTALIZE-N and FRACTALIZE-REC take two lists and generate a recursive pattern based upon the mapping of the first over the second list.

### FRACTALIZE-N
#### Inputs:
- List of MIDI Cent values
- List of MIDI Cent values
- Number of recursion levels to generate
#### Outputs:
- List of MIDI Cent values (pattern based upon the mapping of the first list over the second list)

### FRACTALIZE-REC
FRACTALIZE-REC is another recursive version of FRACTALIZE-N.
#### Inputs:
- a motif given as a MIDIcent list
- a MIDICent list of distances
- the number of recursion levels to generate.
#### Outputs:
- List of MIDI Cent values (pattern based upon the mapping of the first list over the second list)


## Remarks
The current folder consists of:<br>

- fractalize-n.omp - the main patch.<br> 
- fractalize-n-help.omp - a help patch containing an example and some operating mode instructions.<br>
- fractalize-rec.omp - a variant of the main patch.<br>
- fractalize_rec-help.omp - a help patch containing an example and some operating mode instructions.<br>
- onset-dur.omp - subsidiary patch for regular onset/duration generation

- fractalize-n-help ALL.omp - same as "fractalize-n-help.omp" but self-contained, i.e. it contains the patches "fractalize-n-help.omp" and "glosa-figur-help.omp" as abstractions.<br>


## Revision history:
- 2018, May: Release on GitHub<br>
- 2008, May: OM version for release.<br>
- 2001: Initial design and programming in OM after a version made in GFA Basic (Atari ST) in 1989.<br>
